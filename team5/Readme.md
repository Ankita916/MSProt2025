# 🧬 Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Workflow

This document outlines the typical steps in an R-based mass spectrometry proteomics workflow.

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

### 1. 📁 PXD Dataset ID/Address  
↓  
(*e.g., `PXD012345` from [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/)*)

---

### 2. ⚙️ QFeatures (MzID Import)  
↓  
(*Input mzIdentML/mzML files or MaxQuant results via `readQFeatures()` or `readMzTab()`*)

---

### 3. 🔄 Aggregation  
↓  
(*Aggregate features to peptides/proteins using `aggregateFeatures()` or similar methods*)

---

### 4. 🧼 Normalization & Imputation  
↓  
(*Normalize using `normalize()` or `normalize_vsn()`, impute with `impute()` for missing values*)

---

### 5. 🧪 Protein Inference & Quantification  
↓  
(*Summarize peptides into proteins, optionally using `MSstats` or `DEP`*)

---

### 6. 📊 Statistical Analysis (Differential Expression)  
↓  
(*e.g., `test_diff()` for group comparisons, log2 fold-change + adjusted p-value filtering*)

---

### 7. 📈 Visualization & Export  
↓  
(*Generate PCA, heatmap, volcano plot using `ggplot2`, `DEP`, or `ComplexHeatmap`*)

---

### 8. 📖 Comparison with the Published Version of the Study  
↓  
(*Compare overlap of DEPs, visual summaries, pathway enrichment, etc.*)
